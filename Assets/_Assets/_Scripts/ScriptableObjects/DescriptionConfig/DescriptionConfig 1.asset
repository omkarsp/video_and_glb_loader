  description: The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-engine multirole fighter jet
    developed by General Dynamics for the U.S. Air Force. Known for its agility,
    speed, and advanced avionics, it has been widely exported and remains in service
    with many air forces worldwide. Its lightweight frame combined with powerful
    thrust gives it superior maneuverability, making it a staple in both air-to-air
    combat and ground-attack missions.
