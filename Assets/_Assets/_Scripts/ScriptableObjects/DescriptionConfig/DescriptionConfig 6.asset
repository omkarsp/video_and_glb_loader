  description: An alarm clock is a simple but essential tool for keeping life on
    schedule. Designed to wake people up at a set time, it can be digital or analog,
    basic or feature-rich with snooze functions, lights, and even smart connectivity.
    Though often taken for granted, the alarm clock plays a critical role in structuring
    daily routines and ensuring punctuality in a fast-paced world.
